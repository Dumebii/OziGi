## What is Ozigi?

Ozigi is a content engine built for technical creators, founders, and builders who have real things to say — but treat writing posts as a tax on their actual work.

You drop in raw context. Ozigi returns polished, platform-specific drafts for X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and Discord. You edit the 10% only you know. You publish.

No prompt engineering. No reformatting for each platform. No AI slop.

## The Core Systems

### 1. Multimodal Ingestion
Drop in a URL, paste raw notes, or upload a PDF/image. Ozigi extracts the core narrative without requiring you to summarise it first. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash's massive context window.

### 2. The Banned Lexicon
Ozigi enforces a strict list of banned words at the API route level — not filtered after the fact, blocked at generation. No "delve", no "robust", no "seamlessly". The model is penalised for AI-speak, which forces output that reads like a professional wrote it.

### 3. System Personas
Instead of prompting "write a tweet about X", you define *who* the AI is. Personas are saved to a database and applied automatically to every campaign. One persona setup. Consistent voice across every post, forever.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Every generated campaign includes an Edit button. Ozigi handles the 90% — extraction, structure, constraints, platform formatting. You own the 10% — the specific detail, the insider context, the judgment call only a human can make. AI as co-pilot, not replacement.

### 5. Native Image Generation
Generate platform-aware graphics directly inside the engine. Blank field = abstract background. Add text = rendered text graphic. LinkedIn posts auto-attach images via a 3-step OAuth handshake on publish.

### 6. Publishing Integrations
- **X (Twitter):** Web Intents pop open a pre-loaded tweet tab for final review before posting
- **LinkedIn:** Direct OAuth publishing with image attachment
- **Discord:** Paste a webhook URL in Settings — campaigns drop straight into your chosen channel

### 7. Email Newsletters
Generate a single newsletter email that summarizes your 3‑day campaign. Write in your voice, include images, and schedule for later delivery. Manage your subscriber list from the dashboard and track sending limits.

### 8. Ozigi Copilot
A built‑in AI assistant that lives in your dashboard. Brainstorm ideas, refine drafts, and get tailored advice – all while keeping your context. Optionally search the web for up‑to‑date information.

### 9. Long-Form Content Generation
Generate comprehensive blog posts, tutorials, and technical documentation. Available for Organization and Enterprise tiers. Choose tone, structure, and length – get MDX-ready output with proper headings, code blocks, and formatting.

### 10. Persona Marketplace
Choose from 8 pre-built personas designed for specific ICP types: Battle-Tested Engineer, DevRel Champion, Technical Founder, and more. Each persona has a distinct voice that produces meaningfully different output. Select one to instantly apply that voice to all your generations.

### 11. Subscription Management
Full subscription lifecycle support including plan upgrades with tailored welcome emails, and self-service cancellation with reason tracking for compliance.

### 12. Pricing & Gating
Free tier includes 5 campaigns/month. Team ($15/mo) unlocks 30 campaigns, image generation, email newsletter, blog distribution, and more. Organization ($39/mo) removes all limits, adds full Copilot access, and enables long-form content generation. Start with a 7‑day trial on the Team plan.

Curious how the Banned Lexicon works at the API level, or how the multimodal ingestion pipeline processes a PDF?

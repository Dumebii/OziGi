## What is Ozigi?

Ozigi is a content engine built for technical creators, founders, and builders who have real things to say — but treat writing posts as a tax on their actual work.

You drop in raw context. Ozigi returns polished, platform-specific drafts for X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and Discord. You edit the 10% only you know. You publish.

No prompt engineering. No reformatting for each platform. No AI slop.

## The Core Systems

### 1. Multimodal Ingestion
Drop in a URL, paste raw notes, or upload a PDF/image. Ozigi extracts the core narrative without requiring you to summarise it first. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash's massive context window.

### 2. The Banned Lexicon
Ozigi enforces a strict list of banned words at the API route level — not filtered after the fact, blocked at generation. No "delve", no "robust", no "seamlessly". The model is penalised for AI-speak, which forces output that reads like a professional wrote it.

### 3. System Personas
Instead of prompting "write a tweet about X", you define *who* the AI is. Personas are saved to a database and applied automatically to every campaign. One persona setup. Consistent voice across every post, forever.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Every generated campaign includes an Edit button. Ozigi handles the 90% — extraction, structure, constraints, platform formatting. You own the 10% — the specific detail, the insider context, the judgment call only a human can make. AI as co-pilot, not replacement.

### 5. Native Image Generation
Generate platform-aware graphics directly inside the engine. Blank field = abstract background. Add text = rendered text graphic. LinkedIn posts auto-attach images via a 3-step OAuth handshake on publish.

### 6. Publishing Integrations
- **X (Twitter):** Web Intents pop open a pre-loaded tweet tab for final review before posting
- **LinkedIn:** Direct OAuth publishing with image attachment
- **Discord:** Paste a webhook URL in Settings — campaigns drop straight into your chosen channel

## Architecture

Curious how the Banned Lexicon works at the API level, or how the multimodal ingestion pipeline processes a PDF?

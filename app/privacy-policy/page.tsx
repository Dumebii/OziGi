            Most web browsers include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) setting that signals to websites that
            you prefer not to be tracked. Because no uniform technical standard for recognizing DNT

            standard is adopted in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.

          <p className="mt-3">
            California law requires us to disclose this practice, and we do so here: we do not

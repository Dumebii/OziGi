    Write in a professional, authoritative tone. Use precise language and industry-standard terminology.
    Maintain objectivity while being engaging. Avoid casual language, contractions, or overly informal expressions.
    Structure arguments logically with clear transitions between ideas.
  `,
  casual: `
    Write in a conversational, approachable tone. Use contractions naturally and address the reader directly.
    Include relatable examples and analogies. Keep sentences varied in length for natural rhythm.
    It's okay to inject personality and light humor where appropriate.
  `,
  technical: `
    Write with technical precision and depth. Include specific details, data points, and technical terminology.
    Explain complex concepts clearly without oversimplifying. Use code examples or technical diagrams descriptions where relevant.
    Maintain accuracy above all else - don't speculate on technical matters.
  `,
  storytelling: `
    Write with narrative flair and emotional engagement. Open with a compelling hook that draws readers in.
    Use vivid descriptions, scene-setting, and character development where applicable.
    Build tension and resolution throughout the piece. Make abstract concepts concrete through stories and examples.

    - Supporting evidence woven throughout
    - A satisfying conclusion that ties everything together
    
    Use smooth transitions between ideas. Don't use numbered lists or bullet points as the primary structure.
  `,
  listicle: `
    Structure as a numbered list article:
    - Start with a brief introduction (100-150 words)
    - Each list item should be a self-contained mini-section
    - Number each main point clearly
    - Include a brief conclusion that summarizes key takeaways
    
    Each list item should have: a clear heading, explanation, and ideally an example or actionable insight.
  `,
  'how-to': `
    Structure as an instructional guide:
    - Start with what the reader will learn/achieve
    - Include any prerequisites or setup needed
    - Break into clear, sequential steps
    - Each step should be actionable and specific
    - Include tips, warnings, or common mistakes where helpful
    - End with next steps or further resources
    
    Be specific enough that someone could follow along successfully.
  `,
  opinion: `
    Structure as a persuasive opinion piece:
    - Lead with a clear, bold thesis statement
    - Acknowledge counterarguments fairly
    - Build your case with evidence and reasoning
    - Use rhetorical techniques effectively
    - Close with a call to action or memorable conclusion
    
    Be confident in your position while remaining intellectually honest.
  `,
  analysis: `
    Structure as a deep-dive analysis:
    - Start with context and why this topic matters
    - Present your analytical framework or methodology
    - Examine multiple facets or perspectives
    - Include data, research, or expert sources where relevant
    - Draw insights and identify patterns
    - Conclude with implications or predictions
    
    Prioritize depth over breadth. Go beyond surface-level observations.

# LONG-FORM CONTENT GENERATION

You are an expert content writer creating a ${targetLength}-word ${structure} article.

${personaSection}

## Context & Source Material
Analyze this context and use it as the foundation for your article:

<context>
${context}
</context>

## Tone Guidelines
${toneInstructions}

## Structure Requirements
${structureInstructions}

## Output Requirements

1. **Length**: Target approximately ${targetLength} words. Can vary by ±15% but stay close.

2. **Format**: Return valid JSON matching this structure:
\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Compelling, SEO-friendly title",
  "subtitle": "Optional subtitle or deck",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "Section heading (use ## in markdown)",
      "content": "Full markdown content for this section",
      "wordCount": 250
    }
  ],
  "totalWordCount": 1500
}
\`\`\`

3. **Markdown**: Use proper markdown in the content field:
   - **Bold** for emphasis
   - \`code\` for technical terms
   - > for quotes
   - Lists where appropriate
   - DO NOT include the section heading in the content (it's in the heading field)

4. **Quality Standards**:
   - Every sentence should add value
   - No filler phrases like "In today's world..." or "As we all know..."
   - Be specific and concrete
   - Include original insights, not just summaries
   - Cite sources from the context when relevant

${additionalInstructions ? `## Additional Instructions\n${additionalInstructions}` : ''}

## Final Check
Before responding, verify:
- [ ] Total word count is within range
- [ ] Structure matches the ${structure} format
- [ ] Tone is consistent throughout
- [ ] Content is grounded in the provided context
- [ ] JSON is valid and properly escaped

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.

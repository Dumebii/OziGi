-- Migration 002: Create marketplace personas table (Option A approach)
-- Purpose: Store the 8 pre-built personas. User selections copy to user_personas with marketplace prompt.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.marketplace_personas (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  order_index INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add indexes for querying marketplace personas
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_marketplace_personas_featured ON public.marketplace_personas(is_featured);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_marketplace_personas_order ON public.marketplace_personas(order_index);

-- Insert the 8 pre-built marketplace personas
INSERT INTO public.marketplace_personas (name, prompt, description, is_featured, order_index) VALUES
